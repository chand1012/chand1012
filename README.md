# About Me
My name is Chandler, and I like to code. Ever since I was 8 or 9, I was fascinated by computers and coding. My first venture into coding was a Lego Mindstorms robot. It was graphical, but it was an algorithm of sorts. My first "real" coding was in Ruby, which while I can still code in, was quickly replaced by Python. Since then, Python has been my go-to for most of my projects and for any sort of quick prototypes I want to develop. I also have used C/C++ and NodeJS, the HTML5 Stack, and have been learning Golang for the past year. Not long ago I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at a division of SealedAir in Northeast Ohio, and it solidified my dream of coding as a full-time job, as well as teaching me a lot about both the field and working for a real company. That lasted about nine months, and currently I am working a min-wage job in my hometown while going to school full time.

# My Big Projects
I started the [WinGuake](https://github.com/chand1012/WinGuake) project, which is supposed to be a port of the Guake Linux terminal for Windows (I haven't been developing on it as much recently due to time constraints, but help would be appreciated and would go toward development!). Recently I have been working heavily on two projects, one that I will release open source in time, and one that has been used by over 100,000 unique users on Discord, that being [Discord-Quick-Meme](https://github.com/chand1012/Discord-Quick-Meme). 

My other hobby is 3D printing, which you can find all of my designs for [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/chand1012/about). I will also be publishing the STEP files to GitHub in the near future.

Finally, I like to write occasionally on [my blog](https://chand1012.dev/). This blog is about any of my projects I think I should write about, random tutorials I feel like writing, and any other random tech topic I want to write about. For your support, I'll put your name on my [Sponsors Page](https://chand1012.dev/sponsors/)!

<h1>GistBin - The GitHub Gist command line client.</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p>So I have always like the idea of being able to share simple snippets of code, but my first real foray into this was using <a href="https://pastebin.com/">PasteBin</a>. The reason I was using PasteBin was because that is what the Minecraft mod, ComputerCraft, allowed you to download code off of the internet easily. I wrote a few programs that are still on <a href="https://pastebin.com/u/chand1012">my PasteBin</a>. Since I found out that GitHub had a competitor in the form of GitHub's Gists, I switched to that. I like the GitHub platform and its easy to switch between the gists and Git, and even clone the gists with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code>. I recently found <a href="https://hastebin.com/about.md">HasteBin</a>, an open source alternative to PasteBin that has a command-line tool. The command-line tool, called <a href="https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client">haste-client</a> is extremely easy to use, only requiring you to pipe in the information you want to upload to HasteBin. You can even host your own <a href="https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server">HasteBin Server</a> and point the haste-client to it. While I liked this, I also liked the ability to have other information about the code that I was sharing, along with being able to look at revisions like git, but haste-client is <em>so easy</em> to use, so I decided to create my own client for Gists.</p>

<h1>Why Discord Bot Development is Flawed.</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p>Before I complain about my experience with Discord bots, let me preamble with this: I enjoy developing the bots. I enjoy making bots that entertain people and that everyone uses for fun and memes. I like my Discord bots, I don't regret developing them, and I will continue development of them. I do not think Discord's current system for bot development should be replaced, it is too prevalent and there is too many bots currently using it.</p>
